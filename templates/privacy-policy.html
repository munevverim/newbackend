        <h2>Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
        <p>
          We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from
          the European Economic Area (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy
          Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data
          collected, and how we maintain this data under protection from being
          replicated or used in the wrong way.
        </p>

        <h2>What is GDPR?</h2>
        <p>
          GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how
          EU residents’ data is protected by companies and enhances the control
          the EU residents have, over their personal data.
        </p>

        <h2>What is personal data?</h2>
        <p>
          Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual.
          GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its
          own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a
          person. Personal data extends beyond a person’s name or email address.
          Some examples include financial information, political opinions,
          genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual
          orientation, and ethnicity. The Data Protection Principles include
          requirements such as:
        </p>
        <p>
          - Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and
          transparent way and should only be used in a way that a person would
          reasonably expect.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose
          and it should only be used for that purpose. Organizations must
          specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.
        </p>
        <p>
          - Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its
          purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          - People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own
          personal data. They can also request a copy of their data, and that
          their data bu updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another
          organization.
        </p>

        <h2>Why is GDPR important?</h2>
        <p>
          GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect
          individuals’ personal data that they collect and process. It also
          raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and
          imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it’s simply the
          right thing to do. At Help Scout we strongly believe that your data
          privacy is very important and we already have solid security and
          privacy practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new
          regulation.
